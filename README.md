Caviar Slack Bot
================

What it does
------------
[Caviar](http://trycaviar.com) is food delivery service used by many startups to deliver dinner to employees. [Slack](http://www.slack.com) is a popular chat program used by many startups. Caviar requires a contact number to send text message updates to, but that contact may change day-to-day. The Caviar Slack bot listens to text messages from Caviar and alerts one your company's Slack channels (or users) whenever updates are sent. It also sends a voice recording to the Caviar delivery person in the rare event that they call the contact number belonging to the bot.

Teespring made a Slack bot and Quizlet is using (a modified version of) it, too! You can run a copy of this bot and automate your dinner process.
